inzva AI Projects #2 - Future Sales Prediction Kaggle Challenge


In this project, we tried to implement entity embeddings for categorical data.

The advantage of using embeddings is that we can determine the number of dimensions to represent the categorical feature as opposed to in one-hot-embedding where we need to break the feature into as many unique values are present for that categorical feature.

For more info on embeddings, we highly recommend reading the paper below.
